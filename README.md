First before you can start the bot you need to download the latest version of Java SE.
The latest version you can find on this website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html

If you have more then one Java Version on your computer you need to change it under "Java Control Panel" then go to "Java" and then click on "View" there you can add your latest version.

Dont forget to restart your computer.
